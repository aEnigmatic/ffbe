Shortly after the War of the Lions commenced, the Church of Glabados fed false information to Duke Goltanna claiming that his old friend had become a traitor, which resulted in Orlandeau being imprisoned in Fort Besselat.",

However, his skills were not enough to subdue the beast, and his sister lost her life trying to shield him from a fatal blow. Tormented by the overwhelming guilt, he decided to give up his sword and began his studies in the arts of the clerics.
